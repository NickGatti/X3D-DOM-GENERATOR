[X3DOM Website](https://doc.x3dom.org/)

## Auto-Render a HTML View From your X3Dom, 3D Printer or X3D compatible files:

```
HTML View Layout based on education of the current X3D file.
Ex: X3D file is a heart, goal is to educate about a heart
Ex: X3D file is a car, goal is to educate about the car
Ex: X3D file is a model of a person, goal is to instruct how to perform exercises
Ex: X3D file is a drone, goal is to instruct on how to build the drone
```

### Note: Scaling for files must be in millimeters (or if using custom indicator must be in the same scale) when imaged for reference indicator to work correctly
```
<X3D>
  <Head>
  </Head>
  <Scene>
    <Background ... />
    <Viewpoint ... />
    <Transform scale='10000 10000 10000'>
      <Transform center="0 0 0" rotation="1 0 0 0.0">
        <Transform center="0 0 0" rotation="0 1 0 0.0">
          <Transform center="0 0 0" rotation="0 0 1 0.0">
          <Shape...
          </Shape
          </Transform>
        </Transform>
      </Transform>
    </Transform>
  </Scene>
</X3D>
```

X3D HTML Generator parses X3Dom and 3D Print compatible XML files then appends HTML to a page according to:

* Shape element and DEF attribute
* Material element and diffuseColor attribute

Also custom set values any 1 attribute within an element (usually "MetadataInteger") that contains another value, appended to button text.
We currently set these in the HTML itself.

Example:
We want the value 'aorta' in 'MetadataInteger' but only the value aorta where the XML element contains IPCCCID and theres more than one 'MetadataInterger' element in the XML.
```
<MetadataInteger containerField='value' name='IPCCCID' value='aorta'>
```
This is set in the HTML.

Then the parser appends HTML using .appendChild() with data out of an array of objects for buttons like 'Diagnosis Info' to work around not using an iFrame. In the future will use a framework to accomplish more of the appending.

## Future Plans and TODO list

```
Current: Integrate Information Views (modals) for event actions
1. ~3/2018 After semester 2 at Galvanize and more understanding of databases and the full stack, rewrite the structure so it's easier to implement into a full stack
2. ~5/2018 After semester 3 at Galvanize and more understanding of frameworks, add a framework like react.js, angular or vue
```

### Documentation

#### At the head:
I use Lato as a nice readable text and viewport.
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato" rel="stylesheet">
<meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
```

#### At the top of the body:

```html
<div id='x3d_generator_wrapper'>

    <div id='x3d_generator_info_button_wrapper'>
    </div>

    <div id="x3d_generator_shape_def_button_wrapper">
    </div>

    <div id='x3d_generator_x3d_content_wrapper'>

        <x3d id='x3d_generator_x3d_wrapper'>
            <scene id='x3d_generator_x3d_scene'>

            <scene id='x3d_generator_x3d_scene_reference'>
            </scene>
        </x3d>

        <div id='x3d_generator_image_div'>
            <img id='x3d_generator_image_img_element'>

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### At the bottom of the HTML:
Then this JavaScript file must be inserted before we include the script that appends the buttons, or else we get errors (like jQuery).
Current this is a separate settings file it can be put straight into the HTML inside a script tag or not.
These values represent how button appending will work.

```javascript
    //IF USING THE AORTA EXAMPLE
    //Which X3D file to render
    const SETTINGS_FILE_xmlFile = '../database/clients/example-aorta/modelFile.x3d';
    //Specify the X3D reference file for the PIP window
    const SETTINGS_FILE_referenceFile = '../database/referenceModels/aorta/referenceModel.x3d';

    //The text for the 'metaDataButton'
    const SETTINGS_FILE_metaDataInfoButtonText = 'MetaData Info';

    //Image file extension
    const SETTINGS_FILE_imageFileExtension = 'png';

    //The XML element to find the metaDataInfoAttribute in
    //We are looking for <MetadataInteger containerField='value' name='IPCCCID' value='aorta'>
    const SETTINGS_FILE_metaDataInfoElement = 'MetadataInteger';

    //The XML element for MetadataInteger must contain
    //We are looking for name='IPCCCID'
    const SETTINGS_FILE_mustContainElement = 'name';

    //The XML value for mustContainElement to look for
    //We are looking for name = 'IPCCCID'
    const SETTINGS_FILE_mustContainValue = 'IPCCCID';

    //Which XML attribute to look for to display on the metaDataButton
    //Here value = "aorta"
    const SETTINGS_FILE_metaDataInfoAttribute = 'value';

    //The text for the 'htmlInfoButton'
    const SETTINGS_FILE_htmlInfoButtonText = 'Diagnosis Info';

    //What HTML to display when the 'displayHTMLinfo' button is clicked
    const SETTINGS_FILE_htmlInfoButtonHTML = [{
            "p": "Example p tag"
        },
        {
            "container": {
                "outerType": "ul",
                "innerType": "li",
                "contents": [
                    "example list and list items",
                    "example list and list items",
                    "example list and list items",
                    "example list and list items"
                ]
            }
        }
    ];

    // What HTML to display when the instructions button is clicked
    const SETTINGS_FILE_instructionsHTML = [{
            "h2": "Instructions"
        },
        {
            "p": "Mouse Button"
        },
        {
            "p": "LMB (Left Mouse Button) - Rotate, hold and move"
        },
        {
            "p": "MMB (Middle Mouse Button or Wheel) -  Zoom, hold and move"
        },
        {
            "p": "RMB (Right Mouse Button) - Pan, hold and move"
        }
    ];

    // What to display when a X3D Element gets clicked on
    // Object Key must be the same name as the Shape DEF name in the X3D file
    const SETTINGS_FILE_modalWindowInfo = {
        //Using back-ticks in the aorta info (back quotes)
        'Aorta': `
          <p>Aorta info...</p>`,
        'Calcification': 'Calcification info...'
    }
```

The X3Dom script is loaded by the button appending JavaScript, but we are loading the CSS from the HTML here:

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='http://www.x3dom.org/x3dom/release/x3dom.css' />
```

The next line is the button appending JavaScript and must be below the inline JavaScript in the HTML above

```html
<script type='text/javascript' src='js/index.js'></script>
<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='css/style.css' />
<script type='text/javascript' src='js/referenceModel.js'></script>
```

#### To get the 2D drawing to work:

Its filename must match the 'metaDataInfo' text and (at the moment) must be a .png file.

In the 'example-aorta.html' case the 'metaDataInfo' is 'aorta' so the file name must be 'aorta.png'.
___
 We locate the file in:
 '../database/metaDataInfo/2Dimages'
___
 The full path would be:
 '../database/metaDataInfo/2Dimages/aorta.png'
___

#### Lookout!
Some servers are caps sensitive, if you are not super savvy and something is not working check the caps, try to keep it consistent!


In the 'example-heart.html' case the 'metaDataInfo' is 'Heart' so the file name must be 'Heart.png'.
___
 We locate the file in:
 '../database/metaDataInfo/2Dimages'
___
 The full path would be:
 '../database/metaDataInfo/2Dimages/Heart.png'
___
